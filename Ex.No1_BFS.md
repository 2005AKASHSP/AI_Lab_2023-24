# Ex.No: 1  Implementation of Breadth First Search
### DATE: 
### AIM: 
To write a python program to implement Breadth first Search. 
### Steps:
1.Start the program 
2.Create the graph by using adjacency list representation 
3. Define a function bfs and take the set “visited” is empty and “queue” is empty 
 Step 4: Search start with initial node and add the node to visited and queue.
 Step 5: For each neighbor node, check node is not in visited then add node to visited and queue list.
 Step 6: Creating loop to print the visited node.
 Step 7: Call the bfs function by passing arguments visited, graph and starting node.
Step 8:  Stop the program.


### Program:


### Output:


### Result:
Thust the program was performed sucessfully.
